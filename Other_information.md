sup1

(We crossed sup#1 uni-1DT/+ plants with Col wild-type plants, and F2 seeds were obtained from sup#1/+ uni-1DT/+ Ws/Col F1 hybrids. We next collected 88 kanamycin-resistant F2 individuals with wild-type morphologies, 
Because the sup#1 mutation was expected to be located on chr 4, we next examined which region of chr 4 displayed the most significant enrichment of Ws-type homozygous SNPs. To this end, chr 4 was divided into 500 kb intervals and the ratios of homozygous SNPs to heterozygous SNPs in each 500 kb interval were plotted (Fig. 1A). A peak was observed at the 8,000 k–8,500 k interval, suggesting that the sup#1 mutation was located around there. As chr 1 also displayed slight enrichment of homozygous SNPs (Table 2), we drew the same type of graph for chr 1. As expected, a peak was observed in the southern part (Fig. 1B), in agreement with the uni-1DT transgene being located there. Next, to estimate the region containing the sup#1 mutation more precisely, the 6,000 k–10,000 k region of chr 4 was divided into 50 kb intervals and enrichment of homozygous SNPs in each 50 kb interval was plotted (Fig. 1C). Relatively high peaks were detected between 6,850 k and 9,100 k, and thus we decided to focus on the 6,800 k–9,150 k region that contains all high peaks.)
