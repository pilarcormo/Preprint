#Reference-free identification of genomic regions carrying a causal mutation.

###Abstract
###Background
- NGS useful for mappping mutations.
- Forward genetic screens.
- Current available SNP/Variant calling methods for forward genetics experiments: NGM, Shoremap, CandiSNP, MutMap... Advantages and limitations
- Need for reference-free method. 
- Brief explnation of SDM. Why Arabidopsis is a great genomic model. 
- Oportunities for the future.

###Results
######Homozygous SNPs in forward genetics screens are normally distributed around the causative mutation

######Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome I and the expected SNP distributions used as a model to test the algorithm

######A pre-filtering step based on the homozygous to heterozygous SNPs ratio is crucial to define the contigs surrounding the mutation. 
 
######Filtering non-unique SNPs in the mutants reduces complexity and improves SDM accuracy

######SDM succesfully identifies the genomic region carrying the causative mutation using real SNP densities
