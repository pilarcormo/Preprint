#Additional figures

**Additional figure 1** (A) Simplified diagram of model genome creation. (B) The homozygous to heterozygous SNP ratio is calculated by fragment. The absolute number of homozygous SNPs in a fragment plus 1 are divided by the absolute number of heterozygous SNPs in the same fragment. 

**Additional figure 2** Differences in the Hom/het ratio density by adding a different factor (1, 0.1 and 0.0.1) to numerator and denominator. 

**Additional figure 3** Change in the homozygous SNP density plot before filtering, after background SNPs filtering and centromere removal.

**Additional figure 4** Recovery of SNP density correlation to normal after SDM for 5 different and independent mutants (OCF2, BCF2, bak1-5 mob1/mob2 and sup#1). Simple linear regression was used to determine the relationship. Programme was run twice with and without pre-filtering step.
